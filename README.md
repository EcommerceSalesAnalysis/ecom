Project Overview
This project aims to analyze sales data from Amazon using a robust ETL pipeline built with dbt (Data Build Tool) and Snowflake as the data warehouse. The analysis focuses on various aspects of sales performance, including product performance, promotions, seasonal trends, and geographical insights. The project is designed to provide actionable insights to help improve business strategies.

Tech Stack
dbt: For data transformation and modeling.
Snowflake: As the data warehouse solution.
Python: Used for advanced data analysis and potential machine learning integration.
Fivetran: For automated data ingestion.
Git: Version control.
Data Pipeline Overview
Include a visual overview of your data pipeline here.

The data pipeline starts with ingesting sales data from Google Sheets into Snowflake using Fivetran. The data is then transformed using dbt, where it goes through multiple stages, including staging, intermediate transformations, and finally, the creation of fact and dimension tables (data marts).

Project DAG
Include an image of your project's DAG here.

The DAG represents the flow of data from raw ingestion to final analysis models. Each node in the DAG represents a transformation step, from cleaning the data in staging models to aggregating key metrics in data marts.

Data Sources
Google Sheets: Contains the raw sales data from Amazon.
Fivetran: Used to automatically sync data from Google Sheets to Snowflake.
Models Breakdown
Staging Models
The staging models clean and prepare the raw data for further transformations. Key transformations include:

Handling null values in critical columns like Amount.
Standardizing the Status field to ensure consistency across the dataset.
Filtering out irrelevant or erroneous data, such as canceled or damaged shipments.
Intermediate Models
Intermediate models aggregate and organize the data to answer specific business questions. These models include:

int_product_sales: Aggregates sales data by SKU, category, and state.
int_seasonal_trends: Summarizes sales trends by month and product category.
Data Marts (Fact & Dimension Tables)
The final data marts are structured to support detailed business intelligence analysis:

Fact Tables:
fct_product_performance: Tracks product performance, including revenue, returns, and cancellations.
fct_promotion_impact: Measures the impact of promotions on sales performance.
fct_seasonal_trends: Analyzes sales trends across different seasons.
fct_geography_performance: Provides insights into sales performance across different states.
Analysis and Insights
Key Business Questions Answered
What are the top-selling products by quantity sold and revenue generated?
How do promotions impact product sales and revenue?
What are the seasonal trends affecting sales performance?
How does sales performance vary by state?
Include visuals like charts or graphs to illustrate the insights.

Future Enhancements
Machine Learning Integration: Implement predictive models to forecast sales and identify potential customer segments.
Advanced Visualization: Create interactive dashboards using Python libraries like Plotly and Dash.
Real-Time Data Ingestion: Explore streaming data ingestion for real-time analysis.
